Right now we have the rotating Teapot example, and we want to turn this into Peregrine the 1980s flight-sim retro thing.

We need the vertices for an airplane, for our external view, or if it were a world plane rather than player's plane, then it would make sense to draw it.  Now the original Falcon used ironically bitmaps for rendering the Mig-21s, and there was no external view of the F-16, iirc; however, we're going to use modern techniques as much as possible, though we may simplify some steps and we will render proper respects to the 1980s in subtle ways, hopefully...



We need to draw a sky and a ground.  


Could start with a flat ground.


Need a game time loop, render passing and all that.


Need to hookup the joystick eventually, but could start with keyboard flight commands.
