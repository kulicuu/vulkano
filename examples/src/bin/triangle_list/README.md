# Triangle List From .Hgt File



This is a utility that accepts an .hgt file and outputs a mesh.  This could be turned into a server for distributed simulations, where terrain could be loaded from remote sources instead of being stored and/or generated locally, which would be either space or computation-time intensive.


It's not an example graphics application, but I guess it could be considered an example graphics application supporting utility.
